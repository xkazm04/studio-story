# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** A regular person can produce a high-quality, compelling, publishable story package through an AI-driven interface that adapts to them.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Jinn Package Scaffold and Component Catalog

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 12 (Jinn Package Scaffold and Component Catalog)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (unified panel registry)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.12 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 7 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (2 min)
- Trend: accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Jinn engine phases (1-6) precede Studio Story domain phases (7-10) -- engine must be stable before domain features
- [Roadmap]: Package separation (PKG-02) starts in Phase 1, enforcement (PKG-01) closes in Phase 12 -- boundary maintained throughout, formalized at end
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2+3 can parallelize (both depend only on Phase 1); Phases 8+9+10 can parallelize (all depend on Phase 7)
- [01-01]: Vitest 4 uses test.projects instead of defineWorkspace -- adapted workspace config
- [01-01]: @dzin/core uses JIT (no build step) via Next.js transpilePackages
- [01-01]: PanelFrameProps uses ReactNode for icon/actions/children for max composition flexibility
- [01-02]: PanelDefinition.component uses ComponentType<Record<string, unknown>> -- generic yet type-safe
- [01-02]: serializeRegistry excludes component ref by explicit field mapping rather than delete/omit
- [01-02]: SerializedPanel is a separate type from PanelDefinition rather than Omit<> -- cleaner serialization contract

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research gap]: Claude Code CLI latency for real-time UI composition needs benchmarking in Phase 6
- [Research gap]: Character visual consistency APIs (IPAdapter/cref) need technology research in Phase 9
